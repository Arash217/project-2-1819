# Optimizing volkswagen.nl

## Summary
This readme contains my research on Volkswagen's website and advice on how to improve the accesibility and performance of the website.

## 1. Installation

Fork and/or clone it
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Arash217/project-2-1819
```

Install dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

Run the server (will use port 3000)
```bash
npm start
```

### Optimizations

#### 1. Adding Brotli compression

Most of the assets of the website are compressed with Gzip. 
To reduce the size even further, Brotli compression can be used.
I took the HTML, CSS and JavaScript files of the website, 
added Brotli compression and compared them with the Gzipped version of the website. 

##### Results

</p>

Note: I only took three files, to show the difference between Gzip and Brotli compression. 
The website still has other files that can be compressed with Brotli.

#### 2. Minifying and compressing SVG files

The SVG files of the website aren't minified or compressed. 
Minifying them and adding Gzip and/or Brotli compression can be used to further reduce the sizes of the SVG files.

##### Results

</p>

Note: I only took the SVG files on the homepage to minify and compress.
I didn't test the SVG files on the other pages.

#### 3. WebP images

The images on the website are mostly jpg, with the exception of some png, gif and svg.
Converting these images to WebP can reduce the size significantly.

Note: I only took the JPG and PNG images on the homepage to convert to WebP.
I didn't test the images on the other pages.

#### 4. FOIT

The website uses a custom font which is applied when it's loaded.
However, because of this loading, the text will be invisible until the custom font is loaded, causing Flash of Invisible Text (FOIT).

##### Original

</p>

##### Fix

This issue can be solved by adding 'font-display: swap;' to all '@font-face' rules.

```diff
@font-face {
    font-family: VWHeadWeb;
    src: url(../../../Fonts/VW-PKW/VWHeadWeb-Light.woff2) format("woff2"), 
         url(../../../Fonts/VW-PKW/VWHeadWeb-Light.woff) format("woff");
    font-weight: 300;
    font-style: normal;
    font-display: swap;
}
...
```

This, however caused the anchor tags to be unstyled until the CSS file was loaded.
I solved this issue by adding a style sheet directly in the html:

```diff
<style>
a {
  color: #41494c;
}
</style>
```

It also could have been in a separate CSS file, but I didn't test this.

##### Result

</p>

Note: the dropdown menu (Meer) in the navigation is shown when the JavaScript file is loaded.
This issue can for example be solved by adding the JavaScript responsible for the menu directly in the HTML file as a script tag.

##### Reflow

While 'font-display: swap;' works, 
it might cause reflow, since the fallback font family and the custom font family have different font sizes.
This issue can be solved by making sure that the font sizes match. 
[Font style matcher](https://meowni.ca/font-style-matcher/) for example, can be used for this.

#### 5. Service Worker

Initially, my idea was to cache third party scripts in the website with a service worker, 
but it didn't work out because the scripts have dynamic urls.
However, a service worker can still be used to cache the files that are cached by the browser itself (HTTP cache).
Using a service worker along browser/HTTP cache will give you more control over the cache, since you can use the power of a programming language. 

##### Results

##### Browser/HTTP cache

##### Service worker

</p>

Note: I used as a proof of concept, the tool sw-precache to generate a service worker which caches the assets of the website.
The config file (sw-precache-config.js) for the service worker can be found in the root directory of the project.
However, this tool is deprecated and shouldn't be used in production. 
Use [Workbox](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/workbox) instead if you want/need to use tooling to generate service workers for production.
